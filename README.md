# My Toy Renderer
Everyone's got one...

This is a little showcase to learn PBR shading and modern OpenGL.

Some Features Include
+ PBR Lighting
+ Cascaded Shadow Mapping (For the sunlight)
+ Modern OpenGL (Bindless resources and MultidrawElementsIndirect used for batching)
+ GLTF Loading (Specifically written for the Sponza file included, not robust enough yet for arbitrary GLTF files)
